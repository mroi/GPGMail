    // Bug #943: Make sure the GPGMail preference item is only added once.
    //
    // In theory -[GPGMailBundle registerBundle] is responsible for registering
    // the preference panel of GPGMail with Mail.app
    // This however only works, if an instance of MailPreferences already exists,
    // which seems to only be the case, if it was instantiated by a second plugin.
    // Otherwise +[MailPreferences sharedPreferences] would return nil and the
    // preference panel would not be registered.
    // To fix this problem, GPGMail hooked into +[MailPreferences sharedPreferences]
    // This however lead to the problem that the preference panel might have been registered
    // twice, if a second plugin was available which was loaded *prior* to GPGMail being
    // loaded.
    // In that case the preference panel would be loaded once in +[MailPreferences sharedPreferences]
    // and again in -[GPGMailBundle registerBundle].
    // In order to make sure that the preference panel is really only registered once, the code
    // hook on +[MailPreferences sharedPreferences] has been moved here.
    // This method is called by Mail, once the preference window is loaded,
    // and is probably the best place to add GPGMail's preference panel, if
    // it has not been already added from -[GPGMailBundle registerBundle]
    
    // At this point, the preference panel has been registered by -[GPGMailBundle registerBundle]
    // if a second plugin is available and has been loaded first, so it's safe, to trust the
    // bundles registered in preference owners.
    // Only if GPGMail's NSPreferencesModule is not yet present, it will be registered.
    NSPreferences *preferences = [NSClassFromString(@"MailPreferences") sharedPreferences];
    NSPreferencesModule *gpgMailPreferences = [GPGMailPreferences sharedInstance];
    NSArray *preferencesModules = [preferences valueForKey:@"_preferenceOwners"];
    NSString *panelName = [GPGMailBundle preferencesPanelName];

    // Register the preference panel if it's not already registered.
