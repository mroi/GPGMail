/**
 This method is called by Mail.app when a new message is to be sent or a draft
 is to be saved.
 Based on the message contents it creates all necessary mime parts, signs 
 and/or encrypts the message and creates the outgoing message which is then returned.
 
 If the message is neither to be encrypted or signed, the original method is called
 and the resulting outgoing message returned.
 Otherwise Mail's original method is used too, since internally it calls the methods
 for signing and encrypting the message (see MimePart.newEncryptedPartWithData:data recipients:encryptedData: and MimePart.newSignedPartWithData:sender:signatureData:).
 Unfortunately S/MIME uses different mime parts, so the encrypted data is retrieved
 from the created outgoing message and a new message with the PGP MIME/inline 
 mime parts is created and the encrypted data added.
 
 The same happens for only PGP signed messages.

 This method adds some info to the original method headers which is relevant
 for the encryption and signing methods.
 
 Unfortunately within MimePart.newEncryptedPartWithData:recipients:encryptedData: and 
 MimePart.newSignedPartWithData:sender:signatureData: there's no way of knowing 
 whether the message should be S/MIME signed/encrypted or PGP signed/encrypted, since
 only the relevant email addresses from the original headers are passed in.
 
 To guess the method to be used within these methods, the email addresses are prefixed
 with 'gpg-flagged-<id>-<header-key>::' if the OpenPGP checkbox is checked.
 
 In addition this prefix is used to distinguish bcc recipients from normal recipients.
 GPG allows to add bcc recipients which receive the message, but the encrypted
 or signed data contains no information that these recipients exist.
 As it seems it's not necessary for S/MIME to treat the two types of recipients 
 differentely.
 
 Based on what operations are performed (signing, encrypting, encrypting+signing)
 different info is added to the original headers.
 forEncrypting and forSigning decide which headers are added.
